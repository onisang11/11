    """
    An approximation algorithm for any k ≥ 3, provides a solution for the social aware assignment problem with a ratio of 1/(k-1).

    As described in the article under the section "Algorithm 1: Match and Merge".

    Function receives a graph G and a number k, and returns a partition P of G of all matched sets.

    The algorithm consists of k - 1 rounds. Each round is composed of a matching phase followed by a merging phase.
    Specifically, in round l MnM computes a maximum matching, M_l ⊆ E_l , for G_l (where G_1 = G). In the merging phase, MnM creates a graph
    G_(l+1) that includes a unified node for each pair of matched nodes. G_(l+1) also includes all unmatched nodes, along with their
    edges to the unified nodes. Clearly, each node in V_l is composed of up-to l nodes
    from V_1. Finally, MnM returns the partition, P, of all the matched sets.

    :param G: Graph
    :param k: Number of passengers
    :return: A partition P of G of all matched sets
    
    Example where G={(v1,v2),(v2,v3),(v3,v4),(v4,v5),(v4,v6)} and k=4:
    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> list_of_edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]
    >>> G.add_edges_from(list_of_edges)
    >>> k = 4
    >>> print(match_and_merge(G, k))
